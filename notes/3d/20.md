Suppose $n$ is a positive integer and $A_{i,j} \in \mathbf F$ for $i,j = 1,\dots,n$. Prove that the following are equivalent (note that in both parts below, the number of equations equals the number of variables):
1. The trivial solution $x_1 = \dots = x_n = 0$ is the only solution to the homogeneous system of equations
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{k=1}^n A_{1,k}x_k &= 0 \\
&\vdots \\
\sum_{k=1}^n A_{n,k}x_k &= 0 \\
\end{aligned}
$$
2. For every $c_1,\dots,c_n \in \mathbf F$, there exists a solution to the system of equations
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{k=1}^n A_{1,k}x_k &= 0 \\
&\vdots \\
\sum_{k=1}^n A_{n,k}x_k &= 0 \\
\end{aligned}
$$
