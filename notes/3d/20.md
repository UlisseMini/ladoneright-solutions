Suppose $n$ is a positive integer and $A_{i,j} \in \mathbf F$ for $i,j = 1,\dots,n$. Prove that the following are equivalent (note that in both parts below, the number of equations equals the number of variables):
1. The trivial solution $x_1 = \dots = x_n = 0$ is the only solution to the homogeneous system of equations
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{k=1}^n A_{1,k}x_k &= 0 \\
&\vdots \\
\sum_{k=1}^n A_{n,k}x_k &= 0 \\
\end{aligned}
$$
2. For every $c_1,\dots,c_n \in \mathbf F$, there exists a solution to the system of equations
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{k=1}^n A_{1,k}x_k &= 0 \\
&\vdots \\
\sum_{k=1}^n A_{n,k}x_k &= 0 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $T \in \mathcal L(\mathbf F^n)$ be the linear operator corresponding to the matrix $A$.  [[3.69]] tells the following are equvalent
1. $Tx = 0$ iff $x = 0$ ($T$ is injective)
2. for every $b \in \mathbf F^n$ there exists an $x \in \mathbf F^n$ with $Tx = b$  ($T$ is surjective)

todo: cite theorems to make more rigorous (it's obvious to me so I'm not motivated to be rigorous)
