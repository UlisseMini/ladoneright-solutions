Suppose $T \in \mathcal L(U,V)$ and $S \in \mathcal L(V,W)$ are both invertible linear maps. Prove that $ST \in \mathcal L(U,W)$ is invertible and that $(ST)^{-1} = T^{-1}S^{-1}$.

We have
$$
(ST)(T^{-1}S^{-1}) = SS^{-1} = I
$$
And
$$
(T^{-1}S^{-1})(ST) = T^{-1}T = I
$$
Therefor $(ST)$ is invertible and $(ST)^{-1} = T^{-1}S^{-1}$.
