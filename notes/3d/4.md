Suppose $W$ is finite-dimensional and $T_1,T_2 \in \mathcal L(V,W)$. Prove that $\text{null }T_1 = \text{null }T_2$ if and only if there exists an invertible operator $S \in \mathcal L(W)$ such that $T_1 = ST_2$.

In other words, find an isomorphism $S$ between the output ranges such that $T_1 = ST_2$.

Suppose $\text{null }T_1 = \text{null }T_2$. Let $u_1,\dots,u_n$ be a basis for $\text{null }T_1$ then extend it to a basis $u_1,\dots,u_n,v_1,\dots,v_r$ of $V$. By [[3.22]] we know $r = \dim \text{range }T_1 = \dim \text{range }T_2$, define $w_k = T_1v_k$ and $w_k' = T_2v_k$. Since any $w \in \text{range }T_1$ can be written
$$
\begin{aligned}
w = T_1v
&= T_1(a_1u_1 + \dots + a_nu_n + b_1v_1+\dots+b_rv_r) \\
&= a_1w_1 + \dots + a_rw_r
\end{aligned}
$$
We have that $w_1,\dots,w_r$ spans $\text{range }T_1$, since $r = \dim \text{range }T_1$ [[2.42]] implies $w_1,\dots,w_r$ is a basis of $\text{range }T_1$.  Exactly the same logic shows that $w_1',\dots,w_r'$  is a basis of $\text{range }T_2$.
Extend to bases $w_1,\dots,w_m$ and $w_1',\dots,w_m'$ of $W$ then define $Sw_k' = w_k$. $S$ is clearly an isomorphism as we're just relabeling one basis into another.
To see $T_1=ST_2$ consider $v = a_1u_1+\dots+a_nu_n+b_1v_1+\dots+b_rv_r$ and

$$
T_1v = b_1w_1 + \dots + b_rw_r = S(b_1w_1' + \dots + b_rw_r') = ST_2v
$$

Now suppose $T_1 = ST_2$. If $v \in \text{null }T_1$ then $T_1 v = 0 = ST_2 = 0$ implies $T_2 = 0$ since $S$ is injective. and if $v \in \text{null }T_2$ then clearly $T_1v = 0$.

I spent more then 2 hours finding a short, rigorous, somewhat understandable proof. I did compromise a bit at the end, assuming the reader can make reasonable inferences on their own.
