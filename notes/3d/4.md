Suppose $W$ is finite-dimensional and $T_1,T_2 \in \mathcal L(V,W)$. Prove that $\text{null }T_1 = \text{null }T_2$ if and only if there exists an invertible operator $S \in \mathcal L(W)$ such that $T_1 = ST_2$.

(In other words, find an isomorphism $S$ between the output ranges such that $T_1 = ST_2$.)

Suppose $\text{null }T_1 = \text{null }T_2$. Let $N$ denote the nullspace, by [[2.34]] there exists a subspace $U$ such that $U \oplus N = V$.

Let $R_1 = \text{range }T_1, R_2 = \text{range }T_2$. Both $T_1$ and $T_2$ are invertible when treated as maps from $U$ to their range (restricting inputs to $U$ makes them injective, treating the outputs as the range makes them surjective).
I'll denote the restricted maps as $\tilde T_1 \in \mathcal L(U, R_1)$ and $\tilde T_2 \in \mathcal L(U, R_2)$.

If $w = \tilde T_2u$ then $\tilde T_1 \tilde T_2^{-1} w = \tilde T_1 u$. This leads us to define $S = \tilde T_1 \tilde T_2^{-1}$, clearly $S \in \mathcal L(R_2, R_1)$ is invertible as it's the product of two invertible maps.

We've found the desired isomorphism between the ranges, now we just need to extend $S$ to be invertible on all of $W$, this is straightforward since [[2.34]] gives us subspaces $R_1',R_2'$ such that $W = R_1\oplus R_1'=R_2\oplus R_2'$. Since dimensions match [[3.59]] allows us to find an isomorphism $S' : R_1' \to R_2'$ so we can finish our definition of $S \in \mathcal L(W)$ with
$$
Sw = S(r_1 + r_1') = \tilde T_1\tilde T_2^{-1}r_1 + S'r_1'
$$

Verifying $T_1 = ST_2$ is straightforward, write each $v \in V$ as $v = u + n$ to get
$$
ST_2(u + n) = \tilde T_1\tilde T_2^{-1}T_2u = \tilde T_1 \tilde T_2^{-1}\tilde T_2u = \tilde T_1u = T_1(u + n)
$$

todo: explain why direct sums are needed to ensure maps are well defined (currently left implicit)
todo: add diagram of what $S$ looks like

(Old, bad proof. left here for it's historic value)

Suppose $\text{null }T_1 = \text{null }T_2$. Let $u_1,\dots,u_n$ be a basis for $\text{null }T_1$ then extend it to a basis $u_1,\dots,u_n,v_1,\dots,v_r$ of $V$. By [[3.22]] we know $r = \dim \text{range }T_1 = \dim \text{range }T_2$, define $w_k = T_1v_k$ and $w_k' = T_2v_k$. Since any $w \in \text{range }T_1$ can be written

$$
\begin{aligned}
w = T_1v
&= T_1(a_1u_1 + \dots + a_nu_n + b_1v_1+\dots+b_rv_r) \\
&= b_1w_1 + \dots + b_rw_r
\end{aligned}
$$

We have that $w_1,\dots,w_r$ spans $\text{range }T_1$, since $r = \dim \text{range }T_1$ [[2.42]] implies $w_1,\dots,w_r$ is a basis of $\text{range }T_1$. Exactly the same logic shows that $w_1',\dots,w_r'$ is a basis of $\text{range }T_2$.
Extend to bases $w_1,\dots,w_m$ and $w_1',\dots,w_m'$ of $W$ then define $Sw_k' = w_k$. $S$ is clearly an isomorphism as we're just relabeling one basis into another.
To see $T_1=ST_2$ consider $v = a_1u_1+\dots+a_nu_n+b_1v_1+\dots+b_rv_r$ and

$$
T_1v = b_1w_1 + \dots + b_rw_r = S(b_1w_1' + \dots + b_rw_r') = ST_2v
$$

Now suppose $T_1 = ST_2$. If $v \in \text{null }T_1$ then $T_1 v = 0 = ST_2 = 0$ implies $T_2 = 0$ since $S$ is injective. and if $v \in \text{null }T_2$ then clearly $T_1v = 0$.

I spent more then 2 hours finding a short, rigorous, somewhat understandable proof. I did compromise a bit at the end, assuming the reader can make reasonable inferences on their own.

edit: I found a better proof, I'll leave the other one for reference
