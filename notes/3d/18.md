Show that $V$ and $\mathcal L(\mathbf F, V)$ are isomorphic vector spaces.

By [[3.61]] 
$$
\dim \mathcal L(\mathbf F,V) = (\dim \mathbf F)(\dim V) = \dim V
$$
Since dimensions are equal [[3.59]] shows they are isomorphic

This is foreshadowing for 3.F where we see that $V$ and $\mathcal L(\mathbf F,V)$ are intimately connected (one is the dual of the other)
