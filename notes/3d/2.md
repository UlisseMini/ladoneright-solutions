Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $\dim V > 1$. Prove that the set of noninvertible operators on $V$ is not a subspace of $\mathcal L(V)$.

It isn't closed under addition, the sum of noninvertible operators can be invertible. For an example let $v_1,v_2$  be independent vectors in $V$ and define
$$
T(c_1v_1 + c_2v_2) = c_1v_1 \quad\text{and}\quad S(c_1v_1 + c_2v_2) = c_2v_2
$$
$T$ and $S$ are clearly not invertible, but $T + S$ is the identity, which is clearly invertible!

Another way to view this is in terms of matrices
$$
\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}}_{T}
+
\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}}_{S}
= 
\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}}_{I}
$$
