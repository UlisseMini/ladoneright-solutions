Prove or disprove: there exists a basis $p_0,p_1,p_2,p_3$ of $\mathcal P_3(\mathbf F)$ such that none of the polynomials $p_0,p_1,p_2,p_3$ has degree $2$.

Let
$$(p_0,p_1,p_2,p_3) = (1,x,x^2+x^3,x^2-x^3)$$
It's clearly spanning as $(p_2+p_3) = 2x^2$ and $(p_2-p_3) = 2x^3$. to see independance consider
$$
a_0 + a_1x + a_2(x^2 + x^3) + a_3(x^2-x^3) = 0
$$
Distribute
$$
a_0 + a_1x + (a_2+a_3)x^2 + (a_2-a_3)x^3 = 0
$$
Since $(1,x,x^2,x^3)$ is independent this implies
$$
a_0 = a_1 = (a_2 + a_3) = (a_2 - a_3) = 0
$$
Which implies $a_2=a_3=0$ (add and subtract to isolate $a_2,a_3$ like we did before).

Thus we have found a basis as requested, and are done.

I really hate this computational proof of independance which should have been a reference to 2.42. It's exactly the same style as [[2a/6]]
