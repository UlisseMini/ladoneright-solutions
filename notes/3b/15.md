Prove that there does not exist a linear map from $\mathbf F^5$ to $\mathbf F^2$ whose null space equals
$$
\{(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5) \in \mathbf F^5 : x_1 = 3x_2 \text{ and } x_3 = x_4 = x_5\}
$$

---

This nullspace has dimension 2, since we can pick $x_1,x_3$ to determine the others. [[3.22]] implies $\dim \text{range }T = 3$, but $\text{range }T \subseteq \mathbf F^2$ so it can't have bigger dimension! (see 2.38). Therefor $T$ cannot exist
