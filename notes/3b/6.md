Prove there does not exist a linear map $T : \mathbf R^5 \to \mathbf R^5$ such that
$$
\text{range }T = \text{null }T
$$

---

By the Fundemental Theorem of Linear Maps (3.22) we must have
$$
\dim \text{range }T + \dim \text{null }T = 5
$$
Which is impossible if $\text{range }T = \text{null }T$ as it would imply  $\dim \text{range }T = 5/2$.
