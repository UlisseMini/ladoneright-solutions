Suppose $T$ is a linear map from $\mathbf F^4$ to $\mathbf F^2$ such that
$$
\text{null } T = \{(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4) \in \mathbf F^4 : x_1 = 5x_2 \text{ and } x_3 = 7x_4\}
$$
Prove that $T$ is surjective.

By the Fundemental Theorem of Linear Maps (3.22)
$$
\dim \text{range }T + \dim \text{null }T = 4
$$
Since $\dim \text{null }T = 2$ (exercise to the reader) this implies $\dim \text{range }T = 2$ so we can let $v_1,v_2$ be a basis of $\text{range }T$, extending (2.33) this basis to a basis of $\mathbf F^2$ doesn't add anything, implying $v_1,v_2$ is already a basis for $\mathbf F^2$.

I feel there should be a theoremin the book  I could cite to show if $U$ is a subspace of $V$, $U = V$ iff $\dim U = \dim V$.

Proof: Let $u_1,\dots,u_m$ be a basis of $U$ and extend it to a basis of $V$. Since $\dim U = \dim V$ extending it does nothing, thus $u_1,\dots,u_m$ is already a basis for $V$ and so $U = V$.
