Give an example of a linear map $T$ such that $\dim \text{null } T = 3$ and $\dim \text{range } T = 2$.

Consider $T \in \mathcal L(\mathbf R^5, \mathbf R^2)$ (we pick $\mathbf R^5$ to satisfy 3.22) defined by
$$
T(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5) = (x_1, x_2)
$$

Clearly $\text{range } T$ spans $\mathbf R^2$ so $\dim \text{range } T = 2$. The nullspace is of dimension 3 since we may set $x_3,x_4,x_5$ to anything.
