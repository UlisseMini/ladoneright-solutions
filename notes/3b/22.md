Suppose $U$ and $V$ are finite-dimensional vector spaces and $S \in \mathcal L(V,W)$ and $T \in \mathcal L(U,V)$. Prove that
$$
\dim \text{null }ST \le \dim \text{null }S + \dim \text{null }T
$$

---

It sufficies to show
$$
\dim \text{null }ST
= \dim \text{null }S|_{\text{range }T}
+ \dim \text{null T}
$$
Since $\text{null }S|_{\text{range }T} \subseteq \text{null }S$ makes the inequality obvious
$$
\dim \text{null }ST \le \dim \text{null }S + \dim \text{null }T
$$

In order to prove $\dim \text{null }ST = \dim \text{null }S|_{\text{range }T} + \dim \text{null }T$ I'm going to construct $u_1,\dots,u_m$ which is a basis for $\text{null }ST$ such that $u_1,\dots,u_r$ is a basis for $\text{null }T$ and $Tu_{r+1},\dots,Tu_m$ is a basis for $\text{null }S|_{\text{range }T}$.

Let $u_1,\dots,u_r$ be a basis for $\text{null }T$ then extend it to a basis $u_1,\dots,u_m$ of $\text{null }ST$. It suffices to show $Tu_{r+1},\dots,Tu_m$ is a basis for $\text{null }S|_{\text{range }T}$. It's independent because if
$$
a_{r+1}Tu_{r+1} + \dots + a_mTu_m = 0
$$
Then (by linearity) $a_{r+1}u_{r+1} + \dots + a_mu_m \in \text{null }T$ meaning we can write
$$
b_1u_1 + \dots + b_ru_r = a_{r+1}u_{r+1} + \dots + a_mu_m
$$
Independence of $u_1,\dots,u_m$ implies each $b_j = a_j = 0$. Thus $Tu_{r+1},\dots,Tu_m$ is independent, now it suffices to show it spans $\text{null }S|_{\text{range }T}$.
Let $v \in \text{null }S|_{\text{range }T}$. since $v \in \text{range }T$ there is some $u\in U$ such that $v = Tu$, and since $STu = 0$ we can write 
$$
u = c_1u_1+\dots+c_mu_m
$$
Apply $T$ to both sides and use the fact that $Tu_j = 0$ for $1 \le j \le r$
$$
v = c_{r+1}Tu_{r+1} + \dots + c_mTu_m
$$
Which shows that $Tu_{r+1},\dots,Tu_m$ spans $\text{null }S|_{\text{range }T}$ completing the proof that it is a basis.

I don't like how long it took to prove $\text{null }ST = \text{null }S|_{\text{range }T} + \text{null }T$.  todo: look for a shorter proof by starting with a basis for $\text{null }S|_{\text{range }T}$

This was intuitively obvious but annoying to prove rigorously. My first solution (shown below) is ugly and I think wrong. I'll leave it here though since it's instructive

Old (bad) Solution
---------------------

Let $u_1,\dots,u_r$ be a basis for $\text{null }T$, since $\text{null }T \subseteq \text{null }ST$ we can extend it to a basis $u_1,\dots,u_m$ of $\text{null }ST$. Let $R = \text{span}(u_{r+1},\dots,u_m)$. $T|_R$ ($T$ restricted to $R$) is injective since
$$
\text{null }T|_R = \text{null($T$)} \cap R = \text{span}(u_1,\dots,u_r) \cap \text{span}(u_{r+1},\dots,u_m) = \{0\}
$$
Therefor $Tu_{r+1},\dots,Tu_m$ are linearly independent in $V$ meaning we can extend it to a basis of $V$
$$
Tu_{r+1},\dots,Tu_m,v_1,\dots,v_n
$$
which implies $\dim \text{null }ST \le \dim \text{null }S + \dim \text{null }T$ since we constructed a basis for $\text{null }S$ and $\text{null }T$ by extending a basis of $\text{null }ST$.
