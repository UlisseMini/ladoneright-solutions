Suppose $U$ is a 3-dimensional subspace of $\mathbf R^8$ and that $T$ is a linear map from $\mathbf R^8$ to $\mathbf R^5$ such that $\text{null }T = U$. Prove that $T$ is surjective.

By [[3.22]]
$$
\dim \text{range }T + \dim \text{null }T = 8
$$
Since $\text{null }T = U$, $\dim \text{null }T = 3$ implying
$$
\dim \text{range }T = 5 = \dim \mathbf R^5
$$

Since $\text{range }T$ is a subspace of $\mathbf R^5$ and their dimensions equal, we have $\text{range }T = \mathbf R^5$ (by basis extension like in [[3b/13]])
