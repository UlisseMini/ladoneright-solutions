Show that
$$
\{
T\in \mathcal L(\mathbf R^5, \mathbf R^4)
: \dim \text{null }T > 2
\}
$$
Is not a subspace of $\mathcal L(\mathbf R^5, \mathbf R^4)$.

---

It isn't closed under addition, consider
$$
\begin{aligned}
T(x_1,\dots,x_5) &= (x_1,x_2,0,0,0) \\
S(x_1,\dots,x_5) &= (0,0,x_3,x_4,0)
\end{aligned}
$$
Both $S,T$ are in the subspace since their nullspaces are three dimensional, but
$$
(S + T) = (x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,0)
$$
Is not as it's nullspace is only one dimensional.
