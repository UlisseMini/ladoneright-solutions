Suppose $W$ is finite-dimensional and $T_1,T_2 \in \mathcal L(V,W).$ Prove that $\text{null } T_1 \subseteq \text{null }T_2$ if and only if there exists $S \in \mathcal L(W,W)$ such that $T_2 = ST_1$.

Since the ranges are subsets of $W$ they're finite-dimensional.

First suppose $\text{null }T_1 \subseteq \text{null }T_2$. 
Let $w_1,\dots,w_r$ be a basis for $\text{range }T_1$ and define $Sw_j = T_2v_j$ where $w_j = Tv_j$.
Now extend to a basis $w_1,\dots,w_m$ of $W$ and define $T_1 w_j = 0$ for all $r < j \le m$. 
Now for any $v \in V$ we can write

Second suppose $S \in \mathcal L(W,W)$ such that $T_2 = ST_1$. Clearly $\text{null }T_1 \subseteq \text{null }ST_1 = \text{null }T_2$.
