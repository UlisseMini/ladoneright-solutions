Suppose there exists a linear map on $V$ whose null space and range are both finite-dimensional. Prove that $V$ is finite-dimensional.

(Note [[3.22]] doesn't apply here since it assumes $V$ is finite-dimensional. [[2.34]] Also can't be used till we know $V$ is finite.)

Let $T$ be our linear map. Let $v_1,\dots,v_m$ be independent vectors in $V$ such that $Tv_1,\dots,Tv_r$ is a basis for $\text{range }T$ and $v_{r+1},\dots,v_m$ is a basis for $\text{null }T$.

Let $v \in V$, since $Tv_1,\dots,Tv_r$ is a basis for the range we can write
$$
Tv = a_1Tv_1 + \dots + a_rTv
$$
Subtract the right hand side and use linearity to get
$$
T(v - a_1v_1 - \dots - a_rv_r) = 0
$$
Since $v_{r+1},\dots,v_{m}$ is a basis for the nullspace we can write
$$
v - a_1v_1 - \dots - a_rv_r = a_{r+1}v_{r+1} + \dots + a_mv_m
$$
Rearranging gives
$$
v = a_1v_1 + \dots + a_mv_m
$$
Implying $\text{span}(v_1,\dots,v_m) = V$ meaning $V$ is finite-dimensional.

It isn't needed for the question but we can also show $v_1,\dots,v_m$ is linearly independent with a similar trick of tactically applying $T$
$$
\begin{aligned}
&a_1v_1+\dots+a_mv_m = 0 \\
&\implies a_1Tv_1+\dots+a_rTv_r = 0 \\
&\implies a_1=\dots=a_r=0 \\
&\implies a_{r+1}v_{r+1} + \dots + a_mv_m = 0 \\
&\implies a_{r+1} = \dots + a_m = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Corralary: We can replace the "$V$ is finite" assumption with "null $T$ and range $T$ are finite" in [[3.22]].

The first time I did  this exercise it was really hard (took more then an hour). When an exercise is hard I let myself relax my mental rigor requirement and work backwords from "why is this intuitively true" to a proof, filling in holes as I go.

I don't think I would have solved this without knowing every vector can be represented as a sum of range and null components (which I learned in 1806). I worked backwards from there

The second time (now) the proof was totally obvious and I was able to clean it up a good bit. I guess I've improved :)
