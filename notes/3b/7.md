Suppose $V$ and $W$ are finite-dimensional with $2 \le \dim V \le \dim W$.
Show that $\{T \in \mathcal L(V,W) : T \text{ is not injective}\}$ is not a subspace of $\mathcal L(V,W)$.

This is the same as [[3b/4]], non-injectivity isn't closed under addition.

Let $v_1,\dots,v_m$ be a basis for $V$ and $w_1,\dots,w_n$ be a basis for $W$. Define (note $a_2$ exists as $\dim V \ge 2$)
$$
\begin{aligned}
T(a_1v_1 + \dots + a_mv_m) &= a_2w_2 + \dots + a_mw_m \\
S(a_1v_1 + \dots + a_mv_m) &= a_1w_1
\end{aligned}
$$
Both $T$ and $S$ are not injective since $Tv_1 = 0$ and $Sv_2 = 0$. But
$$
(S+T)(a_1v_1+\dots+a_mv_m) = a_1w_1 + \dots + a_mw_m
$$
is injective, thus the given set is not a subspace as it isn't closed under addition.
