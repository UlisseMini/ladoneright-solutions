Suppose $T \in \mathcal L(V,W)$ is injective and $v_1,\dots,v_m$ is linearly independent in $V$. Prove that $Tv_1,\dots,Tv_m$ is linearly independent in $W$.

Suppose
$$
a_1(Tv_1) + \dots + a_m(Tv_m) = 0
$$
By linearity this is the same as saying
$$
T(a_1v_1 + \dots + a_mv_m) = 0
$$
Since $T$ is injective $\text{null }T = \{0\}$ so this implies
$$
a_1v_1 + \dots + a_mv_m = 0
$$
Since $v_1,\dots,v_m$ are independent $a_1 = \dots = a_m = 0$ completing the proof.
