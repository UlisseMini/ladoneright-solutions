Suppose $U$ and $V$ are finite-dimensional vector spaces and $S \in \mathcal L(V,W)$ and $T \in \mathcal L(U,V)$. Prove that
$$
\dim \text{range }ST \le \min\{\dim \text{range }S, \dim \text{range }T\}.
$$

Since $\text{range }ST \subseteq \text{range }S$ we immediately have $\dim \text{range }ST \le \text{range }S$
meaning it suffices to show $\dim \text{range }ST \le \text{range }T$.

Consider $S|_R$ as a map from $\text{range }T$ to $\text{range }S$. Apply [[3.22]] to get
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dim \text{range }T
&= \dim \text{range }S|_R + \dim \text{null }S|_R \\
&\ge \dim \text{range }S|_R \\
\end{aligned}
$$
It suffices to show $\dim \text{range }ST = \dim \text{range }S|_R$ since it would imply
$$
\dim \text{range }ST \le \dim \text{range }T
$$

Proof of $\dim \text{range }ST = \dim \text{range }S|_R$. TODO

I learned two new techniques doing this exercise!

- Restricting linear maps then applying [[3.22]] to get inequalities
- Compositions $ST$ can be analyzed by conditioning on the domain. ie. $\text{range }ST = \text{range }S|_{\text{range }T}$ and $\dim \text{null }ST = \dim \text{null }S|_{\text{range }T} + \dim \text{null }T$
