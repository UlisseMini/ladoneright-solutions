Suppose $U$ and $V$ are finite-dimensional vector spaces and $S \in \mathcal L(V,W)$ and $T \in \mathcal L(U,V)$. Prove that
$$
\dim \text{range }ST \le \min\{\dim \text{range }S, \dim \text{range }T\}.
$$

I'll show $\dim \text{range }ST$ can only be smaller then each individual range.

Let $u_1,\dots,u_m$ be a basis for $U$,
