Suppose $D \in \mathcal L(\mathcal P(\mathbf R), \mathcal P(\mathbf R))$ is such that $\deg Dp = (\deg p) - 1$ for every nonconstant polynomial $p \in \mathcal P(\mathbf R)$. Prove that $D$ is surjective.

Consider $p \in \mathcal P(\mathbf R)$ we must show there exists a $q \in \mathcal P(\mathbf R)$ such that $Dq = p$.
Let $n = (\deg p) + 1$ and consider $D$ as a map from $\mathcal P_n(\mathbf R)$ to itself.
Since $\deg (Dp) = (\deg p) - 1$ we have $\text{null }D = \mathcal P_0(\mathbf R)$ (the space of constants) meaning $\dim \text{null }D = 1$. Therefor by [[3.22]]
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dim \text{range }D
&= \dim \mathcal P_n(\mathbf R) - \dim \text{null }D \\
&= (n+1) - 1 \\
&= \dim \mathcal P_{n-1}(\mathbf R)
\end{aligned}
$$
Thus there exists a $q \in \mathcal P_n$ such that $Dq = p$ for $p \in \mathcal P_{n-1}(\mathbf R)$.

This shows any differential-like operator which takes constants to zero is surjective! I can see how this could be useful in differential equation theory! See [[27]] for a basic example.
