Suppose $V$ and $W$ are	finite-dimensional with $\dim V \ge \dim W \ge 2$.
Show that $\{T \in \mathcal L(V,W) : T\text{ is not surjective}\}$ is not a subspace of $\mathcal L(V,W)$.

Like [[3b/7]] it isn't closed under addition.

Let $v_1,\dots,v_m$ be a basis for $V$ and $w_1,\dots,w_n$ be a basis for $W$. Define
$$
\begin{aligned}
T(a_1v_1+\dots+a_nv_n+\dots+a_mv_m) &= a_2w_2 + \dots + a_nw_n \\
S(a_1v_1+\dots+a_nv_n+\dots+a_mv_m) &= a_1w_1
\end{aligned}
$$
Neither $T$ nor $S$ span $W$, but $(T + S)$ does span $W$.
