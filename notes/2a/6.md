Suppose $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$ is linearly independent in $V$. Prove that the list
$$
v_1-v_2, v_2-v_3, v_3-v_4, v_4
$$
Is also linearly independent.

This is the same list as in [[2a/1]], notice the two lists are "basically the same" (meaning we can get from one to the other and vise versa by taking linear combinations), so their equivilance makes sense.

The proof is quite straightforward, suppose
$$
a_1(v_1-v_2) + a_2(v_2-v_3) + a_3(v_3-v_4) + a_4(v_4) = 0
$$
Then distribute to get
$$
a_1v_1 + (a_2 - a_1)v_2 + (a_3 - a_2)v_3  + (a_4-a_3)v_4 = 0
$$
Since $(v_1,\dots,v_4)$ is linearly independent, this implies
$$
a_1 = (a_2-a_1) = (a_3-a_2) = (a_4-a_3) = 0
$$
Which, using the same telescoping trick as [[2a/1|before]] implies $a_2 = a_3 = a_4 = 0$ (add $a_1$ to $(a_2-a_1)$, etc). This completes the proof.

Looking back I don't like this proof, it's a direct computation which doesn't generalize the intuitive concept I stated at the top.

Let's state the general theorem: If $v_1,\dots,v_n$ are linearly independent in $V$ and $w_1,\dots,w_n$ are such that for all $1 \le k \le n$ there is some choice of  $a_1,\dots,a_n$ so that
$$
v_k = a_1w_1 + \dots + a_nw_n
$$
Then $(w_1,\dots,w_n)$ is linearly independent in $V$.

Proving this is easy once we have access to the tools in 2.B, But should be possible with what you currently know if you feel like trying.
