Prove or give a counterexample: If $v_1,\dots,v_m$ is linearly independent in $V$, then
$$5v_1-4v_2,v_2,v_3,\dots,v_m$$
Is linearly independent

---

The (dumb) direct proof goes very similar to [[2a/6]]
> Suppose
> $$a_1(5v_1-4v_2) + a_2v_2 + \dots + a_mv_m = 0$$
> Then
> $$5a_1 v_1 + (a_2 - 4a_1) v_2 + a_3v_3 + \dots + a_mv_m = 0$$
> Implying $5a_1 = (a_2-4a_1)=a_3=\dots=a_m = 0$ by the independence of $v_1\dots,v_m$
> And $a_2=0$ since $(a_2-4a_1)+4a_1=a_2=0$

This proof works, but has the minor problem of being utterly braindead. 

The morally correct proof is noticing the given vectors span $V$ (same reason as in [[2a/1]]) then applying 2.42, but sadly 2.42 hasn't been introduced yet so this would not be valid.
