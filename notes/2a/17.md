Suppose $p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m$ are polynomials in $\mathcal P_m(\mathbf F)$ such that $p_j(2) = 0$ for each $j$. Prove that $p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m$ is not linearly indepenent in $\mathcal P_m(\mathbf F)$.

The polynomials $(x-2),(x-2)^2,\dots,(x-2)^m$ are independent in $\mathcal P_m(\mathbf F)$, and I claim they span the subspace where $p(2) = 0$.

If we add a constant to our list it's still independent
