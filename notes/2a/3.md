Find a number $t$ such that
$$(3,1,4), (2,-3,5), (5,9,t)$$
Is not linearly independent in $\mathbf R^3$

---

We want (for some $a_k \ne 0$)
$$
a_1(3,1,4) + a_2(2,-3,5) + a_3(5,9,t) = 0
$$
If some $a_k \ne 0$, we must have $a_3 \ne 0$ since $(3,1,4)$ and $(2,-3,5)$ are linearly independent. Therefor we can divide by $a_3$, relabel and rearrange to get
$$
(5,9,t) = b_1 (3,1,4) + b_2(2,-3,5)
$$
We'll pick $b_1, b_2$ to satisfy the first two constraints (the first coordinates must be equal) then pick $t$ to satisfy the last one. 
$$
\begin{cases}
5 = 3b_1 + 2b_2 \\
9 = 1b_1 - 3b_2
\end{cases}
\implies b_1 = 3, b_2 = -2
$$
Which gives $t = 3(4)  - 2(5) = 2$, which is our solution since
$$
-1(5,9,2) + 3(3,1,4) - 2(2,-3,5) = 0
$$
Implying they are linearly dependent.

(I could have skipped the derivation and jumped to this part, but that makes it harder to understand)
