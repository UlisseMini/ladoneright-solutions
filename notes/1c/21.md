Suppose
$$
U = \left\{(x, y, x+y, x-y, 2 x) \in \mathbf{F}^{5}: x, y \in \mathbf{F}\right\}
$$

Find a subspace $W$ of $\mathbf F^5$ such that $\mathbf F^5 = U \oplus W$.

---

Let
$$
W = \left\{(0,0,z_1,z_2,z_3) \in \mathbf{F}^5 : z_1,z_2,z_3 \in \mathbf{F}\right\}
$$
Clearly $U \cap W = \{0\}$ since if $u = w$ then
$$
(x,y,x+y,x-y,2x) = (0,0,z_1,z_2,z_3)
$$
Implies $x=y=0$ which then implies both sides are zero. Thus $U \oplus W$ is a direct sum by 1.45.

To see $U+W = \mathbf F^5$ simply write a general element of $\mathbf F^5$ then solve for $x,y,z_1,z_2,z_3$.
