Prove or give a counterexample: If $U_1,U_2,W$ are subspaces of $V$ such that
$$
V = U_1 \oplus W \quad\text{and}\quad V = U_2 \oplus W
$$
then $U_1 = U_2$.

Let $V = \mathbf R^2$, $W = \{(x,0) : x \in \mathbf R\}$, $U_1 = \{(0,y) : y \in \mathbf R\}$ and $U_2 = \{(y,y) : y \in \mathbf R\}$.

We have $V = U_1 \oplus W = U_2 \oplus W$ but $U_1 \ne U_2$, thus this is a counterexample.

This was counterintuitive to me at first, until I realized the only requirement for a direct sum (of two subspaces) being $U_1 \cap W = \{0\}$ means *any* subspace $U_1$ is direct if it doesn't intersect $W$ (this seems obvious in hindsight, but thinking about it this way makes the non-uniqueness obvious)

Consequences:
- The direct sum in [[2.34]] is not unique
- Extending a basis of $W$ to a basis of $V$ can be done in multiple ways, such that the list we add has a different span. (my intuition before was that it would be the same, which is wrong)


Doing the previous exercises [[1c/21]] and [[1c/23]] made coming up with a counterexample relatively easy.
