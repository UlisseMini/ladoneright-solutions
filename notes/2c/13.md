Suppose $U$ and $W$ are both 4-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbf C^6$. Prove that there exist two vectors in $U \cap W$ such that neither of these vectors is a scalar multiple of the other.

By 2.43
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dim(U \cap W)
&= \dim U + \dim W - \dim(U+W) \\
&= 8 - \dim(U + W) \\
&\ge 2
\end{aligned}
$$
Therefor we can find two independent vectors $v_1,v_2 \in U \cap W$ which clearly won't be scalar multiples of eachother.
