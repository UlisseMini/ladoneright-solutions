Suppose $v_1,\dots,v_m$ is linearly independent in $V$ and $w \in V$. Prove that
$$
\dim \text{span}(v_1 + w,\dots,v_m + w) \ge m - 1
$$

---

It's asking us to prove that adding $w$ can at most decrease the dimension by one.
Intuitively this makes sense since we still have access to the differences $v_j - v_k$ but not individual $v_j$

If $v_1+w,\dots,v_m+w$ is linearly independent the result clearly holds. So let's suppose they're dependent,  In [[2a/10]] we showed this implies  $w \in \text{span}(v_1,\dots,v_m)$.

Write $w = a_1v_1+\dots+a_mv_m$, then
$$
b_1(v_1+w) + \dots + b_m(v_m+w) = 0
$$
Becomes (let $S = b_1+\dots+b_m$)
$$
S(a_1v_1+\dots+a_mv_m)
= -( b_1v_1+\dots+b_mv_m)
$$
Which only happens if
$$
(Sa_1 - b_1)v_1 + \dots + (Sa_m-b_m)v_m = 0
$$
Since $v_1,\dots,v_m$ are independent we must have $Sa_j-b_j = 0$ for all $1 \le j \le m$. The only way for this to happen is $b_j = a_j/S$ meaning there is *exactly one* nonzero combination that gives zero. Let $b_1,\dots,b_m$ be this combination, with $b_j$ being the first nonzero coefficient. This implies we can remove $v_j$ without changing the span since $v_j$ is a combination of other $v$'s
$$
v_j = -(b_1v_1+\dots + b_{j-1}v_{j-1} + b_{j+1}v_{j+1} + \dots +b_mv_m)/b_j
$$
Since there's only one combination that gives zero, after removing $v_j$ the list $(v_1+w,\dots,v_m+w)$ is independent. and so the dimension of the span is $m-1$.
