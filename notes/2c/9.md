Suppose $v_1,\dots,v_m$ is linearly independent in $V$ and $w \in V$. Prove that
$$
\dim \text{span}(v_1 + w,\dots,v_m + w) \ge m - 1
$$

It's asking us to prove that adding $w$ can at most decrease the dimension by one.

If $v_1+w,\dots,v_m+w$ is linearly independent the result clearly holds. So let's suppose they're dependent,  In [[2a/10]] we showed this implies  $w \in \text{span}(v_1,\dots,v_m)$.
