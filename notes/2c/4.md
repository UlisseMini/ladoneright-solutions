1. Let $U = \{p \in \mathcal P_4(\mathbf F) : p(6) = 0\}$. Find a basis for $U$
2. Extend the basis to a basis of $\mathcal P_4(\mathbf F)$
3. Find a subspace $W$ of $\mathcal P_4(\mathbf F)$ such that $\mathcal P_4(\mathbf F) = U \oplus W$

This has the same structure as [[2b/3]] with the subspace from [[2a/17]]. except now we have access to 2.39 so the proofs are much shorter.

Note $\dim \mathcal P_4(\mathbf F) = 5$ and  $\dim U \le 5$ because it's a subspace.

1. Examine $(x-6),\dots,(x-6)^4$. they're independent by the same logic as in [[2a/2]]. they're the right size since $1 \notin U$ implies $\dim U < 5$, and our list of 4 independent vectors in $U$ implies $\dim U \ge 4$. Thus $\dim U = 4$ and applying 2.39 allows us to conclude we have a basis.
2. $(x-6),\dots,(x-6)^4,1$ is independent in $\mathcal P_4(\mathbf F)$  since there's no way to write $1$ using previous terms, (see [[2.21]] a), and the right size (see [[2.39]]) as $\dim \mathcal P_4(\mathbf F) = 5$.
3. Let $W = \text{span}(1)$. Clearly $W \cap U = \{0\}$ and $W+U = V$ by (2).
