You might guess, by analogy with the formula for the number of elements in the union of three subsets of a finite set, that if $U_1,U_2,U_3$ subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space, then

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dim(U_1 + U_2 + U_3)
=\; &\dim U_1 + \dim U_2 + \dim U_3 \\
-\; &\dim(U_1 \cap U_2) - \dim(U_1 \cap U_3) - \dim(U_2 \cap U_3) \\
+\; &\dim(U_1 \cap U_2 + \cap U_3)
\end{aligned}
$$

Prove this or give a counterexample.

TODO: Proof (it's computational, use associativity)
