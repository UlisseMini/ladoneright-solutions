You might guess, by analogy with the formula for the number of elements in the union of three subsets of a finite set, that if $U_1,U_2,U_3$ subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space, then

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dim(U_1 + U_2 + U_3)
=\; &\dim U_1 + \dim U_2 + \dim U_3 \\
-\; &\dim(U_1 \cap U_2) - \dim(U_1 \cap U_3) - \dim(U_2 \cap U_3) \\
+\; &\dim(U_1 \cap U_2 + \cap U_3)
\end{aligned}
$$

Prove this or give a counterexample.

We know subspace addition is associative (see [[1c/17]]) so we can prove this by applying the two subspace case repeatidly

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dim((U_1 + U_2) + U_3)
=\; &\dim(U_1 + U_2) + \dim U_3 \\
-\; &\dim((U_1+U_2) \cap U_3) \\
\end{aligned}
$$
Since $(U_1 + U_2) \cap U_3 = (U_1 \cap U_3)+ (U_2 \cap U_3)$ we can write
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dim((U_1+U_2)\cap U_3)
&= \dim((U_1\cap U_3) + (U_2 \cap U_3)) \\
&= \dim U_1 \cap U_3 + \dim U_2 \cap U_3 \\
&- \dim U_1\cap U_2 \cap U_3
\end{aligned}
$$
In the last line I used
$$(U_1\cap U_3) \cap (U_2 \cap U_3)) = U_1 \cap U_2 \cap U_3$$
Anyway, combine this with the previous result to get
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dim(U_1 + U_2 + U_3)
=\; &\dim U_1 + \dim U_2 + \dim U_3 \\
-\; &\dim(U_1 \cap U_2) - \dim(U_1 \cap U_3) - \dim(U_2 \cap U_3) \\
+\; &\dim(U_1 \cap U_2 + \cap U_3)
\end{aligned}
$$
As desired
