Suppose $V$ and $W$ are finite-dimensional and $T \in \mathcal L(V,W)$. Show that with respect to each choice of bases of $V$ and $W$, the matrix of $T$ has at least $\dim \text{range }T$ nonzero entries.

Let $v_1,\dots,v_n$ and $w_1,\dots,w_m$ be the bases for $V$ and $W$ that will be used for the matrix (we don't control these).

Let $A$ be the matrix of $T$, we can clearly find at least $\dim \text{range }T$ vectors in $v_1,\dots,v_n$ with $Tv_k \ne 0$. This implies there is a nonzero element in each row because
$$
0 \ne Tv_k = \sum_{j=1}^m A_{j,k}w_j
$$
Implies at least one $A_{j,k} \ne 0$ (independence of $W$ basis). doing $r$ times implies the number of nonzero entries is at least $\dim \text{range }T$.

This is the best bound we can get using only the dimension of the range, since the identity matrix has the number of nonzero entries *equal* to the dimension of the range.

todo (easy): Remove "clearly" and make rigorous, but make sure it's still understandable!
