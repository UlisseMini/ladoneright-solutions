Suppose $V$ and $W$ are finite-dimensional and $T \in \mathcal L(V,W)$. Prove that there exists a basis of $V$ and a basis of $W$ such that with respect to these bases, all entries of $\mathcal M(T)$ are $0$ except that the entries in row $j$, column $j$ equal $1$ for $1 \le j \le \dim \text{range }T$.

(This generalizes [[3c/2]])

Pick $w_1,\dots,w_r$ to be a basis for $\text{range } T$, and define $v_1,\dots,v_r$ such that $w_j = Tv_j$. Clearly $v_1,\dots,v_r$ is independent (as dependent would imply $w_1,\dots,w_r$ dependent) meaning we can extend it to a basis $v_1,\dots,v_n$ of $V$.

todo: Is there a way to do this without removing the temp w's? this seems ugly

Use $v_1,\dots,v_n$ as our input basis, and $Tv_1,\dots,Tv_n$ as our output basis. (todo: handle $\dim V \ne \dim W$) Clearly $\mathcal M(T)$ will have ones in the diagonal up to $r = \dim \text{range }T$ since writing $Tv_k$ in terms of the matrix, where $1 \le k \le r$ gives
$$
Tv_k = \sum_{j=1}^n A_{j,k} (Tv_j)
$$
Which by independence of the output basis implies
$$
A_{j,k} = \begin{cases}
1 &\text{if $j = k$} \\
0 &\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Now we have to show $Tv_j = 0$ for $r < j \le n$ . TODO

This was intuitively obvious to me after doing [[3c/2]], but took a while to make rigorous. I need to improve my "rigorous articulation"
