Suppose $w_1,\dots,w_n$ is a basis of $W$ and $V$ is finite-dimensional. Suppose $T \in \mathcal L(V,W)$. Prove that there exists a basis $v_1,\dots,v_m$ of $V$ such that all the entries in the first row of $\mathcal M(T)$ (with repsect to the bases $v_1,\dots,v_m$ and $w_1,\dots,w_n$) are $0$ except for possibly a $1$ in the first row, first column.

(In this exercise, unlike [[3c/3]], you are given the basis of $W$ instead of being able to choose a basis of $W$.)

If $w_1 \notin \text{range }T$  we can write $w_1 = w_r + w_n$ where $w_r = Tv_1$ but $w_n


Now assume $w_1 \in \text{range }T$. Set $v_1$ so $Tv_1 = w_1$  then extend to a basis $v_1,\dots,v_n$ of $V$. For each $k > 1$ we have
$$
T(v_k) = C_kw_1 + \dots
$$
Meaning $T(v_k - C_kv_1)$ has no $w_1$ component, so consider the list
$$
(v_1,v_2-C_2v_1,\dots,v_n-C_nv_1)
$$
It's linearly independent because $a_1v_1 + \dots + a_n(v_n - C_nv_1) = 0$ implies
$$
(a_1 - a_2C_2 - \dots - a_nC_n)v_1 + a_2v_2 + \dots + a_nv_n = 0
$$
Since $v_1,\dots,v_n$ are independent we have $a_2 = \dots = a_n = 0$ meaning the original equation is $a_1v_1 = 0$ thus $a_1 = 0$ as well. So our new list is a basis, and we clearly have
$$
T(a_1v_1 + a_2(v_2 - C_2v_1) + \dots + a_n(v_n - C_nv_1))
= a_1w_1 + b_2w_2 + \dots + b_mw_m
$$
As desired, meaning $\mathcal M(T)$ with respect to the $v_1,\dots,(v_n-C_nv_1)$ basis will have the first row be $(1,0,\dots,0)$.

The first time I attempted this I spent a long time and accomplished nothing. this time I was more relaxed and solved it fairly easily

todo: cleanup, reference theorems
