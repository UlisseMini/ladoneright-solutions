Suppose $w_1,\dots,w_n$ is a basis of $W$ and $V$ is finite-dimensional. Suppose $T \in \mathcal L(V,W)$. Prove that there exists a basis $v_1,\dots,v_m$ of $V$ such that all the entries in the first row of $\mathcal M(T)$ (with repsect to the bases $v_1,\dots,v_m$ and $w_1,\dots,w_n$) are $0$ except for possibly a $1$ in the first row, first column.

(In this exercise, unlike [[3]], you are given the basis of $W$ instead of being able to choose a basis of $W$.)
