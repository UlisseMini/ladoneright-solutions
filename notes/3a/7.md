Prove that if $\dim V = 1$ and $T \in \mathcal L(V,V)$ then there exists $\lambda \in F$ such that $T(v) = \lambda v$ for all $v \in V$.

---

Let $v$ be a basis for $V$, and let $\lambda$ be such that $Tv = \lambda v$. Since any $w \in V$ can be written as $w = cv$ for $c \in \mathbf F$ we have
$$
Tw = cTv = c\lambda v = \lambda w.
