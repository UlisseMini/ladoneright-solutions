Give an example of a function $\phi : \mathbf R^2 \to \mathbf R$ such that
$$
\phi(av) = a\phi(v)
$$
for all $a \in \mathbf R$ and all $v \in \mathbf R^2$ but $\phi$ is not linear.

----

Let $\phi(v) = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2}$ (the distance map). we have $\phi(cv) = c\phi(v)$ for all $c \ge 0$. It doesn't work for negative numbers though.
