Give an example of a function $\phi : \mathbf C \to \mathbf C$ such that
$$
\phi(w+z) = \phi(w) + \phi(z)
$$
for all $w,z \in \mathbf C$  but $\phi$ is not linear. (Here $\mathbf C$ is thought of as a complex vector space.)

If $\phi$ is linear then $\phi(1z) = z\phi(1)$ meaning every value of $\phi$ is determined from $\phi(1)$. We just need to construct a $\phi$ that doesn't have $\phi(z) = z\phi(1)$ but is still additive.

Define $\phi(1) = 1$, additivity immediately implies $\phi(r) = r$ for all rational $r$ (see [[Additive Domain Extension]]). 
Additivity doesn't give us a value for $\phi(i)$ though, meaning we're free to define it as $\phi(i) = 0$. $\phi$ is clearly still additive, but
$$
\phi(i) = 0 \ne i\phi(1) = i
$$
If you prefer to see $\phi$ defined all at once here you go
$$
\phi(a + bi) = \begin{cases}
a &\text{if $b = 0$} \\
0 &\text{if $a = 0$} \\
\end{cases}
$$

The reason it's hard to find $\phi : \mathbf R \to \mathbf R$ is we can show $\phi(rx) = r\phi(x)$ for all rational $r$, meaning we have to somehow squeeze nonlinearity in using irrational scalars!
