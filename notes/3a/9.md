Give an example of a function $\phi : \mathbf C \to \mathbf C$ such that
$$
\phi(w+z) = \phi(w) + \phi(z)
$$
for all $w,z \in \mathbf C$  but $\phi$ is not linear. (Here $\mathbf C$ is thought of as a complex vector space.)

Since we're over $\mathbf C$ we need to find a $z,w \in \mathbf C$ such that $\phi(wz) \ne w\phi(z)$.
