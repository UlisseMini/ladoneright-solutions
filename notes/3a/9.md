Give an example of a function $\varphi : \mathbf C \to \mathbf C$ such that
$$
\varphi(w+z) = \varphi(w) + \varphi(z)
$$
for all $w,z \in \mathbf C$  but $\varphi$ is not linear. (Here $\mathbf C$ is thought of as a complex vector space.)

If $\varphi$ is linear then $\varphi(1z) = z\varphi(1)$ meaning every value of $\varphi$ is determined from $\varphi(1)$. We just need to construct a $\varphi$ that doesn't have $\varphi(z) = z\varphi(1)$ but is still additive.

Define $\varphi(1) = 1$, additivity immediately implies $\varphi(r) = r$ for all rational $r$ (see [[Additive Domain Extension]]). 
Additivity doesn't give us a value for $\varphi(i)$ though, meaning we're free to define it as $\varphi(i) = 0$. $\varphi$ is clearly still additive, but
$$
\varphi(i) = 0 \ne i\varphi(1) = i
$$
If you prefer to see $\varphi$ defined all at once here you go
$$
\varphi(a + bi) = \begin{cases}
a &\text{if $b = 0$} \\
0 &\text{if $a = 0$} \\
\end{cases}
$$

The reason it's hard to find $\varphi : \mathbf R \to \mathbf R$ is we can show $\varphi(rx) = r\varphi(x)$ for all rational $r$, meaning we have to somehow squeeze nonlinearity in using irrational scalars!
